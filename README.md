- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m @the-girl-who-cried-look
- 👀 I’m interested in the why over the what when it comes to adding to my closet.
- 💡 I'm also passionate about my digital closet and [showing others how they can digitize their closet to get analytics about their consumption and style](http://www.cabinet-project.com/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to scale my learnings about personal style, secondhand, tailoring, and mindful buying to the rest of the world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using technology to parse the nuance of personal style and reduce consumption without compromising on personal expression.
